blood pressure was following administration of liters of normal saline respiratory was and his oxygen saturation was on liters nasal cannula his heart had a regular rate and rhythm there were normal first and second heart sounds there was a systolic ejection murmur and there were no rubs or gallops his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally his abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended and there were hypoactive bowel sounds he had a palpable bypass graft pulse hospital3 dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally and his surgical incision was clean dry and intact please note that the above examination was done by the vascular surgery team which was the team that was initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital pertinent laboratory data on presentation on initial laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell count of hematocrit was and platelets were his pt was ptt was and inr was his serum chemistries revealed sodium was potassium was chloride was bicarbonate was blood urea nitrogen was creatinine was and blood glucose was his calcium was magnesium was and phosphate was blood cultures drawn on admission were pending but ultimately negative a urine culture taken on admission was initially pending but ultimately grew out yeast a sputum culture taken on admission was also initially pending but ultimately also grew out yeast radiology imaging his admission chest x ray demonstrated stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery no focal areas of consolidation overall stable appearance of the chest compared with a study no radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia his admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm nonspecific inferior lateral t wave changes low qrs voltages in the limb leads and t wave changes in v5 and v6 when compared with an electrocardiogram dated an initial abdominal ct was a limited noncontrast examination that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification a simple left renal cyst sigmoid diverticulosis and an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland hospital course by system cardiovascular the patient was initially admitted to the vascular intensive care unit with hypotension decreased urine output and acute renal failure most likely secondary to a presumed gram negative urosepsis although there were never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis while boarding in the medical intensive care unit on the night of admission the patient had a sudden cardiorespiratory arrest he was resuscitated with epinephrine lidocaine and direct current cardioversion times four he was also intubate for airway protection following these measures the patient returned to a sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to the return of a pulse was approximately minutes he subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood pressure an echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection fraction of to in the setting of tachycardia and a hyperdynamic right ventricle suggesting elevated right sided filling pressures although the definitive etiology of this arrest remained unknown the most likely trigger was a non q wave myocardial infarction as his troponin values were elevated to greater than following his arrest a repeat echocardiogram done on demonstrated mild left atrial dilation an ejection fraction of to resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferior mid and apical left ventricular akinesis depressed right ventricular systolic function and moderate mitral regurgitation compared with the prior study of the left ventricular function was unchanged there was moderate mitral regurgitation and the right ventricular function appeared worse on the patient was loaded with amiodarone and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone the following day he was started on heparin intravenously given his elevated serum troponin to greater than this medication was continued for hours given his elevated troponins and non q wave myocardial infarction the patient was a candidate for cardiac catheterization after discussions between the medical intensive care unit team and the patient s family however the decision was made to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the patient had been made do not resuscitate do not intubate following the resuscitation mentioned above and his family no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures by he was off pressors and he was restarted on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor at low doses on the evening of the patient complained of substernal chest pain that was relieved by npg sl and morphine he also had st segment depressions in v2 and v3 that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain therefore the patient was again started on heparin although this was discontinued on when the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes he again had substernal chest pain on although he had no electrocardiogram changes and he again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes by hospital day four the patient began to develop evidence of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid resuscitation and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun by the time of his transfer to the general medicine service on the patient was still significantly volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid resuscitation in the medical intensive care unit therefore he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that he was having signs and symptoms of right sided congestive heart failure he achieved adequate diuresis by the time of his discharge to rehabilitation as his oxygen saturation was greater than on liters nasal cannula infectious disease sepsis the patient was started on gentamicin and piperacillin tazobactam in addition to the levofloxacin metronidazole and vancomycin he was already taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram negative urosepsis and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous fluids on his levofloxacin and metronidazole was discontinued and he was started on fluconazole given the growth of yeast on urine culture he was taken off of gentamicin on hospital day three and his fluconazole was discontinued on hospital day five as per the infectious disease service he was taken off of vancomycin on and his piperacillin tazobactam was discontinued on despite the presumption of a gram negative urosepsis precipitating this admission the patient did not have any positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of yeast in two urine cultures noted above he remained afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his antibiotics and he was found to be clostridium difficile negative on pulmonary as noted above the patient was intubated and he was extubated on he subsequently developed wheezing and mild hypoxia most likely secondary to cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his aggressive fluid resuscitation he was gently diuresed toward the end of his hospitalization and by the time of his he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than on liters nasal cannula intermittent ipratropium nebulizers and chest physical therapy for clearance of his respiratory secretions renal the patient presented with acute renal failure and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid resuscitation by the time of discharge his serum creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline nutrition the patient was found to be profoundly malnourished with a serum albumin of on admission once he was extubated and taking orals he performed poorly on a modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin liquid ground solid diet with whole medication tablets small bites and sips upright posture with meals and aspiration precautions he was also given promod shakes with and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his heart healthy diabetic diet vascular the patient s operative incisions and foot ulcers continued to heal throughout this admission he was started on an multivitamin vitamin c and zinc for improved wound healing hematology the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on to maintain a hematocrit of

diagnosed her arrhythmia as asymptomatic episodic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation requiring no intervention with antiarrhythmic medications because she spontaneously converts on her own and only gentle rate control due to repeated episodes of asymptomatic tachycardia due to afib she was taken off of telemetry monitoring per cardiology partial bowel obstruction over the course of the hospitalization she developed a partial bowel obstruction presenting with a tense tender abdomen abdominal pain and nausea gi was consulted who diagnosed the partial obstruction and bleeding as being due to invasion of the colonic wall by her cancer she was made npo and her diet was gently advanced to clears a kub was obtained which ruled out perforation and showed significant constipation supportive laxatives were given orally and rectally daily but to no significant avail to date she has had fewer than bowel movements which have been watery and loose she continues to tolerate a conservative full clear

condition mental status confused sometimes level of consciousness lethargic but arousable activity status bedbound discharge instructions it has been my privilege to take care of you in the hospital you were brought to the hospital because of worsening shortness of breath several imaging studies showed fluid around your heart this fluid was successfully drained without complication and your diffuculty breathing improved radiographic imaging also showed fluid accumulating in your chest cavity known as pleural effusions these fluid collections remained stable and were not thought to be contributing significantly to your shortness of breath because your symptoms improved after draining fluid from around your heart further radiographic imaging of your chest showed clots in both lungs to prevent further clots you were started on an anticoagulation medication but at a low dose because blood clots observed in your rectum raised concern for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the risk of bleeding presented by increasing the anticoagulation medication in the setting of a suspected gastrointestinal bleed the decision was made to place a filter in your inferior vena cava instead the inferior vena cava is a major vein feeding blood into the heart this was done to prevent further clots from being pumped into your lungs this procedure was successfully completed and the decision was made to stop the anticoagulation medication and to start a conservative safe dose of aspirin in its place during your hospitalization you developed several bouts of rapid heart rate found to be caused by an irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation the episodes were controlled with a medication that slows the heart rate to safe levels known as metoprolol cardiology specialists saw you in the hospital and diagnosed your heart rhythm as intermittent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which is a rhythm that often causes patients who have it no symptoms and which corrects itself given this diagnosis and that you experienced no symptoms from the rhythm we stopped 24h monitoring of your heart based on the recommendations of our cardiac colleagues we will be discharging you on metoprolol due in part to your progressive peritoneal cancer you developed a partial bowel obstruction during this hospitalization radiographic imaging showed no evidence of a complete bowel obstruction or evidence of a hole in your bowel but did show that you were quite backed up with stool aggressive bowel regimens were given to you by mouth and per rectum with mixed success you continued to pass gas per rectum over the course of the hospitalization but you only had intermittent watery bowel movements in addition you had several episodes of abdominal pain without associated nausea which were partially relieved with iv and oral morphine after these episodes we made your diet order nothing per mouth npo and slowly advanced your nutrition as tolerated we were very conservative in advancing your diet because you have not had a sizable bowel movement for some time now you will be discharged on an agressive bowel regimen by mouth and per rectum and on a full liquid diet during this hospitalization your kidneys showed temporary signs of dehydration but this resolved with intravenous fluid you were also found to have a suspected urinary tract infection which was treated with oral
